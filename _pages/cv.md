Research Experience
======
* <b>INI-Simons Postdoctoral Research Fellow, University of Cambridge</b>	
  <br />Cambridge, UK July 2023 – Present

<p style="margin-left: 40px">Granted a one-year postdoctoral fellowship funded by the Isaac Newton Institute (INI) and the Simons Foundation to attend the programme “Mathematics of Movement” and build an international collaborative network. Conduct independent research in the mathematical modelling of collective movement. Unite techniques from data science, statistics, and mathematical biology to create novel data-driven models to assess the impact of individual heterogeneity on collective behaviour.</p> 

* <b>Postdoctoral Research Associate, Oxford University</b>
  <br />Oxford, UK January 2022 – July 2023 

<p style="margin-left: 40px">Analysed mathematical frameworks called aggregation-diffusion equations to model long-range cellular interactions in collective migration and pattern formation. Applied Bayesian parameter estimation methods to fit these models to experimental and synthetic data. Collaborated with experimental biologists in Spain and the United States to explain their observations with mathematical modelling. Developed and programmed novel numerical algorithms for simulating models that mix elements of individual-based and continuous frameworks. Co-organised the July 2023 OxPDE workshop on Topics in Collective Migration, Neuroscience, and Parameter Estimation.</p> 

* <b>D.Phil. Research, Mathematical Institute, Oxford University</b>	
  <br />Oxford, UK October 2018 – December 2021

<p style="margin-left: 40px">Investigated mathematical models for collective cell migration within the contexts of embryonic development and tumour-induced angiogenesis (blood vessel formation). Applied techniques from asymptotic analysis to demonstrate equivalences between several microscopic individual-based models (IBMs) and macroscopic population-level models for angiogenesis. Collaborated with theoreticians and experimentalists to create a new IBM for neural crest stem cell migration within a dynamic microenvironment. Identified dominant mechanisms directing cells and guided in vivo experimental design.</p> 


* <b>Senior Undergraduate Thesis, Brown University</b>	
  <br />Providence, RI, USA February 2017 – June 2018

<p style="margin-left: 40px">Developed and simulated a mathematical model for blood clotting (thrombosis) in a two-dimensional vessel experiencing blood flow. This project aimed to help physicians better analyse the development of blood clots over long time periods by making simulations of their onset more efficient and accurate.</p> 

* <b>University of Michigan, Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow</b>
  <br />Ann Arbor, MI, USA May 2017 – August 2017

<p style="margin-left: 40px">Conducted genetic and biochemical screens for blood clotting (thrombosis) under the supervision of Dr. Jordan Shavit, a hematologist/oncologist, in a zebrafish animal model. Assisted in the development of new methods for identifying genetic and biochemical modifiers of thrombosis.</p>
